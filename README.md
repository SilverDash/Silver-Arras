# Same stuff as the original server template, but more!

## File Directory
Stuff you'll likely be editing:
* `lib/definitions.js` - Tank, bullet, and all entity data.
* `config.json` - Map data and other options.
* `server.js` - Everything else, like movement, AI, firing, stats, damage, spawning, etc.! 

Stuff that you probably won't touch:
* `lib/fasttalk.js` - Data compression. No need to change it.
* `lib/hshg.js` - Deals with updating the game grid.
* `lib/random.js` - Contains all the random functions. Also contains the randomized Bot and Boss names, if you want to change them.
* `lib/util.js` - Miscellaneous functions.
* `package.json` - Nothing to edit here, just stuff the client uses to run the game.
